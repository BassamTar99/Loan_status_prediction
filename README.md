# **Loan Status Prediction Model**  

## ðŸ“Œ **Overview**  
This project builds a **machine learning model** to predict whether a loan application will be **approved or denied** based on various applicant and loan-related features. The model helps financial institutions assess risk and make informed lending decisions.  

## ðŸ“Š **Dataset Information**  
The dataset includes **demographic, financial, and credit history** features to determine loan status. Below are the input features used in the model:  

### ðŸ”¹ **Features (X) - Independent Variables**  
1. **person_age** - Age of the applicant  
2. **person_gender** - Gender of the applicant (`encoded as numeric`)  
3. **person_education** - Education level (`encoded as numeric`)  
4. **person_income** - Annual income of the applicant  
5. **person_emp_exp** - Years of employment experience  
6. **person_home_ownership** - Type of home ownership (`encoded as numeric`)  
7. **loan_amnt** - Amount of loan requested  
8. **loan_intent** - Purpose of the loan (`encoded as numeric`)  
9. **loan_int_rate** - Interest rate on the loan  
10. **loan_percent_income** - Loan amount as a percentage of income  
11. **cb_person_cred_hist_length** - Length of credit history in years  
12. **credit_score** - Credit score of the applicant  
13. **previous_loan_defaults_on_file** - Whether the applicant has **defaulted on a previous loan** (`Yes/No â†’ Encoded as numeric`)  

### ðŸ”¹ **Target Variable (y) - Dependent Variable**  
- **loan_status** (Binary: **1** = Approved, **0** = Denied)

## ðŸ›  **Model Selection & Approach**  
### âœ… **Preprocessing Steps**
1. **Missing Values Handling** - Checked and imputed if necessary  
2. **Encoding Categorical Variables** - Applied **Label Encoding** and **One-Hot Encoding** where applicable  
3. **Feature Scaling** - Used **StandardScaler** or **MinMaxScaler** for numerical features  
4. **Train-Test Split** - Split data into **80% training** and **20% testing** (Stratified for balance)  

### ðŸ”¥ **Machine Learning Model: Gradient Boosting**
- The model used is **Gradient Boosting Classifier** (`sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier`).  
- **Why Gradient Boosting?**  
  - Handles **imbalanced datasets** well  
  - Excels at capturing **non-linear relationships**  
  - Performs **feature selection automatically**  
  - Reduces **bias and variance**

## ðŸ“ˆ **Performance Metrics**  
The model was evaluated using the following metrics:  
âœ” **Accuracy Score** - Measures overall correctness  
âœ” **Precision & Recall** - Evaluates false positives & false negatives  
âœ” **F1 Score** - Balances precision and recall  
âœ” **Confusion Matrix** - Visualizes misclassifications  

**Example Confusion Matrix:**  
```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues')
plt.xlabel('Predicted')
plt.ylabel('Actual')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()
```

## ðŸš€ **Future Improvements**  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` to optimize the model  
- **Feature Engineering**: Introduce new features to improve accuracy  
- **Try Different Models**: Compare performance with **Random Forest, SVM, or XGBoost**  
- **Deploy the Model**: Convert it into a web-based API for real-world use
